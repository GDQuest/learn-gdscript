The lights always cycle in the same way: first have the green light, then the orange, then the red.

To represent that cycle, you can periodically add one to the number and use the modulo operator to wrap back to 0.

This is a quick way to reset back to 0 rather than using a conditional statement.

Note that in computer code, we very often count from zero. This is because we don't want to waste any numbers on the computer and the counting system starts at 0."
