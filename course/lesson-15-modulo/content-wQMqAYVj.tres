The lights always cycle in the same way: first, we have the green light, then the orange, then the red.

To represent that cycle, you can periodically add one to the number and use the modulo operator to wrap back to [code]0[/code].

Instead, you could use a condition; In this case, we use the modulo as a shortcut."
