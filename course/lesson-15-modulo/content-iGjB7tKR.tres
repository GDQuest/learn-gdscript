text = "The modulo operator [code]%[/code] calculates the remainder of division. 

For example, if we divide [code]5[/code] by [code]3[/code], we get [code]1[/code] and [code]2[/code] as a remainder.

So [code]5 % 3[/code] gives us the answer of [code]2[/code]. 

Play around with the modulo widget to see how modulo works visually.

Notice the highest the result the modulo operator can give is the divisor [b]minus one[/b]."
