Function identifiers cannot contain spaces. In general, names in programming languages cannot contain spaces.

This is because the computer uses spaces to detect the separation between different keywords and identifiers.

Instead of spaces, in GDScript, we use underscores (\"_\"). You saw this already with functions like [code]move_forward()[/code] or [code]move_local_x()[/code].

Identifiers also have to start with a letter or an underscore; You [i]can't[/i] start with a number, but you can use numbers after the first character."
