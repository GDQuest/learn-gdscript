goal = "You have a function to draw one square: [code]draw_square()[/code]. Use it to draw three squares.

We already created [code]draw_square()[/code] for you. Create a function named [code]draw_three_squares[/code] that calls [code]draw_square()[/code] three times.

If you just call the function, all three squares will overlap. To stack them diagonally, call [code]jump(300, 300)[/code] between two calls to [code]draw_square()[/code]. Calling [code]jump(300, 300)[/code] makes the turtle jump by 300 pixels to the right and 300 pixels down without drawing any lines."
