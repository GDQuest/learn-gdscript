The code defines an empty function named [code]this_code_is_wrong[/code].

To work, the function should use the [code]return[/code] keyword. But this keyword is currently inside a comment, which the computer ignores.

Test the current code by pressing the [i]Run[/i] button.

Then, remove the comment sign (#) to make the code valid.

Be careful not to remove the spacing before [code]return[/code]! Otherwise, that'll cause another error. You may try that too, if you feel like it."
