For example, the [code]position[/code] we mentioned has two coordinates: [code]x[/code] and [code]y[/code].

It's the same for the [code]scale[/code]: it has [code]x[/code] and [code]y[/code] sub-variables. They respectively control the horizontal and vertical size of the game entity.

To access those X and Y sub-components, you add a dot (\".\") after the variable name.

The code below places the entity at [code]180[/code] pixels on the x-axis and [code]120[/code] pixels on the y-axis."
