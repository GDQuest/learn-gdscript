Say we want to reset the rotation to [code]0[/code] and make the character upright. Using the [code]rotate()[/code] function can prove difficult: you need to know the character's exact current angle to cancel it out.

It's much easier to use the member variable rather than the function.

The following code assigns the value [code]0[/code] to the character's rotation, resetting its angle and making it upright."
