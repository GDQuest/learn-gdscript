In games, you need to keep track of many values that change over time:

- The player score.
- Every character or enemy's health.
- The last checkpoint.

And so much more. You need to store, retrieve, and update those values.

We call those values [i]variables[/i]. Variables are labels you use to keep track of values that vary over time. Here's an example of a variable tracking a character or monster's health."
