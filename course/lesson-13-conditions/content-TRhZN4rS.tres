Either the player is pressing the button, or not. Either the character is touching an enemy, or not. 

In our case, [i]if[/i] the health goes over a maximum, we want to reset it to the maximum.

To define a condition, we use the [code]if[/code] keyword. We write a line starting with [code]if[/code], type the condition to evaluate, and end the line with a colon."
