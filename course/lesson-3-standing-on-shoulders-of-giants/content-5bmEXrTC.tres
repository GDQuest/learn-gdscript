text = "The [code]0.3[/code] part between the parentheses is the function's [i]parameter[/i].

Parameters are values (numbers, bits of text, and more) that change how the function behaves. We also call them [i]arguments[/i] (you'll see moving forward there are many synonyms in computer programming). 

Parameters let you fine-tune the effect of the function call. Parameters are rarely optional. For example, calling [code]rotate()[/code], without any parameter, would result in an error. Godot wouldn't know by [i]how much[/i] you intend to rotate the [i]sprite[/i]. 

Don't worry about learning what parameters each function requires or accepts! As a programmer, the documentation will always be close by for you to refer to."
