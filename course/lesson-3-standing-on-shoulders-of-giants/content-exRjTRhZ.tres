text = "Notice how we use a dot in the number [code]0.3[/code] above: you need to use a dot like this to represent decimal numbers. You can't use commas as they have a different purpose in code.

[i]The value of [code]0.3[/code] is an angle in radians. In daily life, we're used to measuring angles in degrees. The radian is another scale commonly used in video games and math.

An angle of [code]PI[/code] radians corresponds to [code]180[/code] degrees. And [code]2 * PI[/code] is a full turn: [code]360[/code] degrees.

Even if you're not familiar with the term radian, you've most likely seen them before.

You find [code]2 * PI[/code] in the calculation of a circle's perimeter, which you probably learned at school ([code]perimeter = 2 * PI * r[/code]). Two times the number PI represents a full turn around the circle in radians.[/i]"
