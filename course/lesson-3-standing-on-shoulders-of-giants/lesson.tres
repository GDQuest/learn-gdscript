For example, calling [code]rotate()[/code] without any argument would result in an error. Godot wouldn't know by [i]how much[/i] you intend to rotate the [i]sprite[/i].

Don't worry about learning what arguments each function requires or accepts! As a programmer, the documentation will always be close by for you to refer to.

text = "The value of [code]0.3[/code] is an angle in [i]radians[/i]. In daily life, we're used to measuring angles in degrees. The radian is another scale commonly used in video games and math.

You can convert radians into degrees by multiplying them by 180 and dividing them by PI:

[code]degrees = radians * 180 / PI[/code]

An angle of [code]PI[/code] radians corresponds to [code]180[/code] degrees. And [code]2 * PI[/code] is a full turn: [code]360[/code] degrees.

[b]How do radians work exactly?[/b]

Radians are a way to measure angles based on the radius of a circle.

To get the angle in radians, you take the circle's radius and wrap it around the circle. That angle is [code]1[/code] radian because you are wrapping the radius [code]1[/code] time around the circle.

Because the perimeter of a circle is [code]2 * PI * radius[/code], a full turn (360Â°) corresponds to [code]2 * PI[/code] radians: you need to wrap the radius of a circle [code]2 * PI[/code] times around the circle to make a full circle."
