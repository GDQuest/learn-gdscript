We increase the values because [code]delta[/code] is so small.

By multiplying the 3 radians by [code]delta[/code], we rotate the character by 3 radians per second.

We also move the character by 500 pixels per second.

When we multiply time sensitive values like this, we make them [b]time-dependent[/b] rather than [b]frame-dependent[/b]."
