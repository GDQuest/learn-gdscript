In the examples below, we artificially made the frames last different times. Some last 0.1 seconds, some as much as 0.7 seconds.

When we use `delta`, the robot takes into account the varying frames so aligns with the desired path; it gets the end of the line at the correct time.



But since the frames are unequal, we get a [b]varying rotation[/b] per second. Because of that, the character seems to jump."
