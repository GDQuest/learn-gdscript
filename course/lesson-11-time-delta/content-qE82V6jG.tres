In the examples below, we artificially made the frames last different times. Some last 0.1 seconds, some 0.2 seconds.

In the first example, we use the [b]same rotation[/b] every frame.

But since the frames are unequal, we get a [b]varying rotation[/b] per second. Because of that, the character seems to jump."
