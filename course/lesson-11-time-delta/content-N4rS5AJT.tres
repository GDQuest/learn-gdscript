Dozens of times per second, Godot runs every [code]_process()[/code] function in the game to update the game world.

After that, it displays an image of the game world on the screen. We call that image a [b]frame[/b].

Godot then moves on to calculating the next frame.

As this happens dozens of times per second, you get the illusion of movement. This is similar to how traditional animation works."
