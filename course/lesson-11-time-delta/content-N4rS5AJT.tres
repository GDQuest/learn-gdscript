Godot runs each [code]_process()[/code] function as fast as it can.

When Godot has run every [code]_process()[/code] function in the game, it has completed one game loop, or [b]frame[/b].

Godot then moves on to the next frame.

And this can happen many, many times a second!

This is how we get fluid motion in games. 

In many ways, each frame is like a page in a flip book."
