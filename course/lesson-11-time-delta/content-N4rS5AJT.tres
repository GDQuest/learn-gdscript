Godot runs each [code]_process()[/code] function as fast as it can.

When Godot has run every [code]_process()[/code] function in the game, it has completed one game loop, or [b]frame[/b].

Godot then moves on to the next frame. This runs very fast, giving us the illusion of movement. This is similar to how movies or animations work, which is why we use the word [b]frame[/b].

And this happens many, many times a second!

This is how we get fluid motion in games. "
