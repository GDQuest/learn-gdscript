However, multiplying by a number below [code]1.0[/code] like [code]delta[/code] makes the result smaller.

To compensate for that and make the robot turn fast enough, we use a larger number than before, [code]3.0[/code] instead of [code]0.05[/code].

Those numbers have two different [i]units[/i]: [code]0.05[/code] is an [i]angle[/i] in radians, while [code]3.0[/code] is an [i]angular speed[/i] in radians per second.

When you multiply a speed by a time delta, it gives you an angle.
