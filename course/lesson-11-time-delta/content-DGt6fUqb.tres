Your computer controls the speed at which each software runs. Depending on how busy the computer is, this can vary.

For that reason, no game engine can guarantee a constant framerate. There will always be milliseconds variations from frame to frame.

That is why the [code]_process()[/code] function receives a [code]delta[/code] parameter.

In mathematics, the word \"delta\" is often used to describe a very small change between two numbers.

The [code]delta[/code] parameter tells us how fast Godot took to complete the [b]previous frame[/b]. We can use that to ensure that the variations between frames have no visible effect."
