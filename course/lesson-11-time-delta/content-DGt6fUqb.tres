We know that Godot runs all the [code]_process()[/code] functions as fast as it can.

The parameter [code]delta[/code] is how fast in seconds Godot took to complete the previous frame.

Because lots of different things happen at different times in games, Godot might take longer to complete one frame.

For example, the player might fire lots of bullets at once, and now Godot has all of these bullets to process!

This means that [code]delta[/code] also varies."
