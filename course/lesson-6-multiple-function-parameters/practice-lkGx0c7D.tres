This will allow us to draw squares and rectangles anytime in our games. We could use them as outlines when selecting units in a tactical game, as a frame for items in an inventory, and more.

Your job is to code a function named [code]draw_rectangle[/code] that takes two arguments: the [code]length[/code] and the [code]height[/code] of the rectangle."
