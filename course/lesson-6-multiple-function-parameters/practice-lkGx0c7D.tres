goal = "Let's make our square drawing function more flexible to include rectangles of varying sizes.

Your job is to code a function named [code]draw_rectangle()[/code] that takes two parameters: the [code]length[/code] and the [code]height[/code] of the rectangle.

Note that we could still draw a square with [code]draw_rectangle()[/code] by having the [code]length[/code] and [code]height[/code] equal the same value."
