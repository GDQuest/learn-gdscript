When you call [code]rotate(0.5)[/code], the function receives the value [code]0.5[/code] under the label [code]radians[/code].

Wherever the computer sees the identifier [code]radians[/code] inside the function, it replaces it with the [code]0.5[/code] value.

The parameter name is always a label you use to refer to a [i]value[/i]. The value in question can be a number, text, or anything else.

For now, we'll stick to numbers as we have yet to see other value types."
