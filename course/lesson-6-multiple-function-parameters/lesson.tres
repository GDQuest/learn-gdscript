You can also write abbreviated names like [code]pos[/code] for position, [code]bg[/code] for background, and so on.

Many programmers do either or both of the above.

At GDQuest, we favor complete and explicit names.

We generally try to write code that is explicit and relatively easy to read.

Right now, you have to enter every letter when you code, so long names may feel inconvenient.

However, this is good for learning: it trains your fingers to [ignore]type precisely.

Then, after you finish this course, you will see that the computer assists you a lot when you code real games with a feature called auto-completion.

Based on a few characters you [ignore]type, it will offer you to complete long names."
