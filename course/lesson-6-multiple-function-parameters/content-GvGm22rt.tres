They are written by us programmers for other programmers. You want to use the names that make the most sense to you and fellow programmers.

You could absolutely write single-letter names like in maths classes: [code]a[/code], [code]b[/code], [code]f[/code].

You can also write abbreviated names like [code]pos[/code] for position, [code]bg[/code] for background, and so on.

Many programmers do either or both of the above.

At GDQuest, we favor complete and explicit names.

We generally try to write code that is explicit and relatively easy to read.

Right now, you have to type every letter when you code, so long names may feel inconvenient.

However, this is good for learning: it trains your fingers to type precisely.

Then, after you finish this course, you will see that the computer assists you a lot when you code real games with a feature called auto-completion.

Based on a few characters you type, it will offer you to complete long names."
