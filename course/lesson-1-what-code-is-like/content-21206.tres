text = "Creating games is more accessible than ever, but it still takes a lot of work and practice. Do not expect any single course, or book, to turn you into a professional. Programming is something you learn through practice.

If something doesn't make immediate sense, don't stress it too much! Keep practicing and come back to it later. Enjoy the learning process, and celebrate every little success.

It's important because you will never stop learning as a game designer and developer. You will keep discovering new and more expressive ways to program as you gain experience.

It's part of the process.

We've been coding professionally for years, and we still learn new things almost every day."
