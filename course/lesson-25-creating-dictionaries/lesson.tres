With just an array of item names, though, we can't easily keep track of the amount of each item.

Instead, we can bundle the item names and amounts into a single [i]dictionary[/i].

A dictionary is a data structure that allows you to map pairs of values. In the pair, we call the first value a [i]key[/i] as we use it to access the second.

In other words, a dictionary has a list of [i]keys[/i], and each key points to a [i]value[/i].

To define a dictionary, we use curly brackets. A colon separates each key and its value. A comma separates each key and value pair."

Precisely, dictionaries use a [i]hashing algorithm[/i]. Hashing algorithms convert one value into another.

In this case, hashing consists of converting a given key into a unique whole number. The dictionary then uses that number as an array's index!

That's how a dictionary works: when you give it a key, it converts it into a unique index and uses that index to retrieve the corresponding value in the computer's memory.

That's also why you can't have the same key twice: it would map to the same array index, causing you to overwrite an existing value."
