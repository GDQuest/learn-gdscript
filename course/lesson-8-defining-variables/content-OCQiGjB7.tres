In your projects, you will need to define your own.

Imagine that you need to track the player's health in your game.

They may start with [code]5[/code] health points. When taking a hit, the health should go down to [code]4[/code]. After another hit, it should be [code]3[/code]. And so on.

To keep track of that, you can create a variable named [code]health[/code] to which you add and subtract points."
