To illustrate how loops work, let's take a game board split into a grid.

Our robot can move to neighboring cells by changing a [code]Vector2[/code] variable named [code]cell[/code]. It represents the current cell the robot is in.

When we increase [code]cell.x[/code], the robot moves to the right.

Note that we delay the robot's movement in the app to help you visualize how it moves. The following code would normally move the robot instantly."

Also, there's a safer kind of loop, [code]for[/code] loops, which we'll look at in the next lesson.

Yet, [code]while[/code] loops have important intermediate to advanced-level uses, so you at least need to know they exist and how to use them.

We use [code]while[/code] loops every time we need to loop an unknown number of times.

For example, games run in a loop that typically generates sixty images per second until the user closes the game. This is possible thanks to [code]while[/code] loops.

There are other good uses for [code]while[/code] loops:

- Reading and processing a file, like a text document, line by line.
- Processing a constant stream of data, like someone recording audio with a microphone.
- Reading code and converting it into instructions the computer understands.
- Various intermediate to advanced-level algorithms, like finding paths around a map for AI."
