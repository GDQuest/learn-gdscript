text = "Our character in our game will have health by defining the `health` variable. The higher the character's health, the further away the player is from losing the game.

Health that changes adds tension to the game, especially if the player is fighting with low health! It's a resource that that player should manage carefully.

The character's health might get low if an enemy attacks them or they fall into a hole.

We can create a function to represent damage in these cases."
