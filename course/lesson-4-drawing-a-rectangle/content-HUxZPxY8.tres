text = "The turtle is a little machine that moves forward, turns, and draws lines along its path.

To make it draw, you give it a list of instructions: on each code line, you call one specific function.

We prepared several functions for you:

- The [code]move_forward()[/code] makes the turtle move forward over a given distance in pixels. 
- The [code]turn_right()[/code] function makes the turtle turn to the right by a precise amount of degrees.
- The [code]turn_left()[/code] function works the same as [code]turn_right()[/code] except the turtle turns to the left.

Calling [code]move_forward()[/code] is similar to the [code]rotate()[/code] function you saw before.

You need to specify the distance in pixels the turtle should move as the function's parameter, inside parentheses.

For example, to move the turtle 200 pixels straight ahead, you'll write [code]move_forward(200)[/code].

The turtle draws a white line as it moves.

We'll use this line to draw shapes."
