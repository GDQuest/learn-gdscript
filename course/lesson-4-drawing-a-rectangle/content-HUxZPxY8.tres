For example, the [code]move_forward[/code] function moves the turtle in the direction it's facing. It takes the distance to travel in pixels as its paramater.

If we use [code]200[/code] as a parameter in the [code]move_forward[/code] function, the turtle travels 200 pixels straight ahead.

The turtle draws a white line where it has travelled.

We'll use this line to draw shapes."
