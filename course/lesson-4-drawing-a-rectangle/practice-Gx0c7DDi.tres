goal = "In this practice, we'll tell the turtle to draw a corner.

The corner is made up of two lines that are [code]200[/code] pixels long. The lines are connected at each end by [code]90[/code] degrees, or right-angle.

The [code]move_forward()[/code] and [code]turn_right()[/code] functions to the right draw a corner, but they're missing some parameters.

Add the missing parameters so the turtle moves forward [code]200[/code] pixels, turns right [code]90[/code] degrees, then moves forward again [code]200[/code] pixels.

We added the first parameter for you so the turtle moves forward [code]200[/code] pixels.

In the following practices, we'll draw multiple corners to create rectangles.
