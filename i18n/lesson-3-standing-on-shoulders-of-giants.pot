"\r\n"
"A function is a bundle of code you can execute anytime. It's a named list"
" of instructions.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"To define a function, you need to write the [code]func[/code] keyword, "

"defines a function named [code]run()[/code].\r\n"
"\r\n"
"You then go to the next line to write the function's body. That's the "
"instructions of the function.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Notice how each instruction starts with a leading [code]Tab[/code] "
"character. The computer uses that to know which lines are part of the "
"function.\r\n"

"Throughout the course, you'll see many functions called "
"[code]run()[/code].\r\n"

"We use parentheses to call functions. This is because you can give the "
"function [i]arguments[/i] inside the parentheses when calling it.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Here's a [i]sprite[/i] standing straight. If we call the "
"[code]rotate(0.3)[/code] function, the character [i]sprite[/i] turns by "
"0.3 units."

"The [code]0.3[/code] part between the parentheses is the function's "
"[i]argument[/i].\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Arguments are values (numbers, bits of text, and more) that change how "
"the function behaves.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Arguments let you fine-tune the effect of the function call. They can be "
"optional at times, but functions often require arguments in order to "
"work.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"For example, calling [code]rotate()[/code] without any argument would "
"result in an error. Without an argument, Godot doesn't know by [i]how "
"much[/i] you intend to rotate the [i]sprite[/i].\r\n"

"Don't worry about memorizing what arguments each function requires or "
"accepts! As a programmer, the documentation will always be close by for "
"you to refer to.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Finally, notice how we use a dot in the number [code]0.3[/code] above: "
"you need to use a dot like this to represent decimal numbers. You can't "

msgid ""
"The value of [code]0.3[/code] is an angle in [i]radians[/i]. In daily "

"scale commonly used in video games and math.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"You can convert radians into degrees by multiplying them by 180 and "
"dividing them by PI:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"[code]degrees = radians * 180 / PI[/code]\r\n"
"\r\n"
"An angle of [code]PI[/code] radians corresponds to [code]180[/code] "
"degrees. And [code]2 * PI[/code] is a full turn: [code]360[/code] "
"degrees.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"[b]How do radians work exactly?[/b]\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Radians are a way to measure angles based on the radius of a circle.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"To get the angle in radians, you take the circle's radius and wrap it "
"around the circle. That angle is [code]1[/code] radian because you are "
"wrapping the radius [code]1[/code] time around the circle.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Because the perimeter of a circle is [code]2 * PI * radius[/code], a full"
" turn (360°) corresponds to [code]2 * PI[/code] radians: you need to wrap"
" the radius of a circle [code]2 * PI[/code] times around the circle to "
"make a full circle."
