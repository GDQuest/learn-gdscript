"In this lesson, we take a first look at variables.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"In games, you need to keep track of many values that change over time:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"- The player's score.\r\n"
"- Every character or enemy's health.\r\n"
"- The last checkpoint.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"And so much more. You need to store, retrieve, and update those values."
"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"We call those values [i]variables[/i]. Variables are labels you use to "
"keep track of values that vary over time. Here's an example of a variable"
" tracking a character or monster's health."

"In this lesson, we start using variables built into Godot. They're a "
"particular kind called [i]member variables[/i].\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Member variables are values attached to a game entity. They're useful "
"properties like the [code]position[/code], [code]rotation[/code], and "
"[code]scale[/code] of a character.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"In a previous lesson, we saw how we could use the [code]rotate()[/code] "
"function to rotate our character."

"This function increases or decreases the value of the entity's "
"[code]rotation[/code] member variable.\r\n"

"Say we want to reset the rotation to [code]0[/code] and make the "
"character upright. Using the [code]rotate()[/code] function can prove "
"difficult: you need to know the character's exact current angle to cancel"
" it out.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"It's much easier to use the member variable rather than the function.\r\n"
"\r\n"

"rotation, resetting its angle and making it upright."

"In video games, you will see many member variables that have sub-values."

"\r\n"

"[code]x[/code] and [code]y[/code].\r\n"
"\r\n"
"It's the same for the [code]scale[/code]: it has [code]x[/code] and "
"[code]y[/code] sub-variables. They respectively control the horizontal "
"and vertical size of the game entity.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"To access those X and Y sub-components, you add a dot (\".\") after the "
"variable name.\r\n"

" mean \"is equal to.\"\r\n"

"This may be confusing if you only saw the y-axis pointing up in math "

" to be perpendicular.\r\n"

"On the computer, the position (0, 0) happens to correspond to the top-"
"left of your computer screen. It then makes sense for coordinates to be "
"positive when going towards the bottom-right corner.\r\n"
