"A vector, in physics, is a quantity with a magnitude and a direction. For"
" example, a force applied to some object, the velocity (speed and "
"directoin) of a character, and so on.\n"

"We often represent it with an arrow.\n"

"In Godot, 2D vectors are a common value type named [code]Vector2[/code],\n"
"\n"
"Unlike plain numbers, they store [i]two[/i] decimal numbers: one for the "
"X coordinate and one for the Y coordinate."
