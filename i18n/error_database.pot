#. Reference: CYCLIC_REFERENCE

msgid ""
"A cyclic reference is when a class references itself, directly or "
"indirectly.\n"
"\n"
"It has two possible causes:\n"
"\n"
"1. You used the class name in the class itself.\n"
"2. Your code refers to another class that refers to this class, causing "
"an endless reference cycle.\n"
"\n"
"Either way, due to how GDScript works in Godot 3, unfortunately,you "
"cannot do this. Godot 4 should solve this problem, but you need to work "
"around it in the meantime."

"Erase the type hint in the error line, and the problem should disappear."

"\n"
"At GDQuest, when we face this error, we remove the type hints on lines "
"causing cyclic references. It solves the problem in the vast majority of "
"cases."

"The indentation of your code (the number of tab characters at the start "

"You are missing one or more tabs, or you inserted too many.\n"

#. Reference: INVALID_INDENTATION
#: ./lsp/error_database.csv:45
msgid ""
"If the line of code with the error is right after a line ending with a "

" the function definition."

"You get this error when you wrote something that is syntactically "

"This kind of error is easy to get as all it takes is one wrong character."

"The way to solve this kind of error is highly contextual. The error "
"message should tell you which character or element it's missing.\n"
"\n"
"If the error says \"expected,\" then you're likely missing something in "
"one of the [b]previous[/b] code lines. It could be a punctuation mark, a "
"parenthesis, or something else.\n"

"When the computer talks about a constant expression, it expects a fixed "

"For example, if the parent has two arguments, you need your new function "

"\n"
"When you make any operation, the computer compares the types you are "

"If the error mentions the assigned value type not matching the variable, "
"the problem is on the right side of the equal sign (=).\n"
"\n"
"If the error talks about the return type not matching the function, then "
"it is the value after the return keyword that is problematic.\n"
"\n"
"If the computer talks about an invalid operand, then the issue is that "
"the operation does not exist for the type you're trying to use. For "

"GDScript supports type inference. The computer will automatically "

#. Reference: TYPE_CANNOT_BE_INFERRED

"The simplest way to solve this error is to remove types for this variable"

"There is an issue with the return value of your function. There are two "

"\n"
"1. Your function is a void function, thus it should not return a value. "
"This includes functions with the '-> void' syntax and class constructors "
"('_init()').\n"
"2. You specified a return type for your function, but you are not "

#. Reference: RETURN_VALUE_MISMATCH
