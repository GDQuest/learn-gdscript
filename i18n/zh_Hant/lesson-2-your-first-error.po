"When you program, you are bound to run into errors. Tons of them.\n"

"But you shouldn't worry! On the computer, [b]errors are a good thing[/b].\n"
"\n"
"You will encounter errors, and [i]that's okay[/i]: every programmer does. "
"Especially professionals.\n"
"\n"
"At school, maybe you learned that mistakes are a bad thing. When you code "
"something, it's not the case: [b]errors help you write correct programs[/b] "
"because they show you what is wrong in your programs."

"當你撰寫程式時，遇到錯誤是難免的，而且會有一堆。\n"
"\n"
"但你不需要擔心！在電腦上，[b]錯誤是好事[/b]。\n"

"在學校，也許你學過錯誤是壞事。在寫程式時，不是這麼一回事：[b]"
"錯誤幫助你寫出正確的程式[/b]，因為它們會告訴你程式中哪裡有問題。"

"We added an error translator in this app that will help you get started.\n"

"錯誤訊息看起來可能有點像加密謎題。這是因為那是由程式設計師，設計給受過訓練的"

"我們在應用程式中新增了「錯誤翻譯機」來幫助你踏出第一步。\n"

"Error messages are designed on purpose by fellow programmers who came before "
"you. They anticipated you might have specific issues and wanted to help you "
"fix them.\n"
"\n"
"You shouldn't think of errors as failures. They are like mentors helping you "
"from the past. Importantly, errors won't break your computer. At least not "
"with GDScript because it's a pretty safe language.\n"
"\n"
"Ultimately, you want to fix all the errors in your program. Understanding "
"what is causing the errors, with the help of error messages, is key to "
"fixing them."

"錯誤訊息是在你之前的程式設計師故意設計的。他們預見到你可能會遇到某些問題，並"
"希望幫助你解決它們。\n"

"你不應該把錯誤當作失敗。它們就像來自過去的導師，是來幫助你的。重要的是，錯誤"
"不會讓你的電腦壞掉，至少在使用 GDScript 時不會，因為這是一種相當安全的語言。"
"\n"
"\n"
"最終，你的目標是修正程式中的所有錯誤。藉由錯誤訊息的幫助，了解錯誤的原因，這"
"將是修正錯誤的關鍵。"
