msgid ""
"A cyclic reference is when a class references itself, directly or "
"indirectly.\n"
"\n"
"It has two possible causes:\n"
"\n"
"1. You used the class name in the class itself.\n"
"2. Your code refers to another class that refers to this class, causing an "
"endless reference cycle.\n"
"\n"
"Either way, due to how GDScript works in Godot 3, unfortunately,you cannot "
"do this. Godot 4 should solve this problem, but you need to work around it "
"in the meantime."

"At GDQuest, when we face this error, we remove the type hints on lines "

#. Reference: INVALID_INDENTATION
#: lsp/error_database.csv:45
msgid ""
"If the line of code with the error is right after a line ending with a "

"\n"
"Note that this error can appear [b]after[/b] the line causing it due to how "

#. Reference: UNEXPECTED_CHARACTER
#: lsp/error_database.csv:54
msgid ""
"The way to solve this kind of error is highly contextual. The error message "
"should tell you which character or element it's missing.\n"
"\n"
"If the error says \"expected,\" then you're likely missing something in one "
"of the [b]previous[/b] code lines. It could be a punctuation mark, a "
"parenthesis, or something else.\n"
"\n"
"If it says \"unterminated,\" you are missing some character at the end of an "

"If the error tells you it expected something, you likely forgot to write a "

"parentheses in a function definition. You can address the error by adding "

"\n"
"If the error says you have something unexpected, you are likely missing a "
"keyword like [code]var[/code], [code]func[/code], [code]for[/code], etc.\n"

"When the computer talks about a constant expression, it expects a fixed "

"\n"
"For example, if the parent has two arguments, you need your new function "

"\n"
"When you make any operation, the computer compares the types you are using.\n"
"\n"
"Some types are compatible, and some are not. For example, you cannot "

"If the error mentions the assigned value type not matching the variable, the "

"\n"
"If the error talks about the return type not matching the function, then it "
"is the value after the return keyword that is problematic.\n"
"\n"
"If the computer talks about an invalid operand, then the issue is that the "

#. Reference: TYPE_CANNOT_BE_INFERRED
