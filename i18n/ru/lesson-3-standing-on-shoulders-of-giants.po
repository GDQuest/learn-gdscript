"A function is a bundle of code you can execute anytime. It's a named list of "

"To define a function, you need to write the [code]func[/code] keyword, the "

"a function named [code]run()[/code].\n"
"\n"
"You then go to the next line to write the function's body. That's the "
"instructions of the function.\n"
"\n"
"Notice how each instruction starts with a leading [code]Tab[/code] "
"character. The computer uses that to know which lines are part of the "

"The [code]0.3[/code] part between the parentheses is the function's "

"Arguments are values (numbers, bits of text, and more) that change how the "

"\n"
"Arguments let you fine-tune the effect of the function call. They can be "
"optional at times, but functions often require arguments in order to work.\n"
"\n"
"For example, calling [code]rotate()[/code] without any argument would result "
"in an error. Without an argument, Godot doesn't know by [i]how much[/i] you "

msgid ""
"The value of [code]0.3[/code] is an angle in [i]radians[/i]. In daily life, "
"we're used to measuring angles in degrees. The radian is another scale "
"commonly used in video games and math.\n"
"\n"
"You can convert radians into degrees by multiplying them by 180 and dividing "
"them by PI:\n"
"\n"
"[code]degrees = radians * 180 / PI[/code]\n"
"\n"
"An angle of [code]PI[/code] radians corresponds to [code]180[/code] degrees. "
"And [code]2 * PI[/code] is a full turn: [code]360[/code] degrees.\n"
"\n"
"[b]How do radians work exactly?[/b]\n"
"\n"
"Radians are a way to measure angles based on the radius of a circle.\n"
"\n"
"To get the angle in radians, you take the circle's radius and wrap it around "
"the circle. That angle is [code]1[/code] radian because you are wrapping the "
"radius [code]1[/code] time around the circle.\n"
"\n"
"Because the perimeter of a circle is [code]2 * PI * radius[/code], a full "
"turn (360°) corresponds to [code]2 * PI[/code] radians: you need to wrap the "
"radius of a circle [code]2 * PI[/code] times around the circle to make a "
"full circle."
