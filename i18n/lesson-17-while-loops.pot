"You've seen that you can use functions to [i]reuse[/i] code. In this "
"lesson, you'll learn about [b]loops[/b]. Loops help you [i]repeat[/i] "
"code.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"To illustrate how loops work, let's take a game board split into a grid."
"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Our robot can move to neighboring cells by changing a "
"[code]Vector2[/code] variable named [code]cell[/code] variable.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"When we increase [code]cell.x[/code], the robot moves to the right.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Note that we delay the robot's movement in the app to help you visualize "
"how it moves. The following code would normally move the robot instantly."

"The above code works for a pre-defined board with a size of "
"[code]Vector2(3, 3)[/code], but the [code]move_to_end()[/code] function "
"wouldn't work if the size of the board was different. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"The robot would either stop before the end or go too far.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"To implement a general solution for all board sizes, we can repeat the "
"robot's movement until it gets to the end.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"For code that repeats, we can use [i]loops[/i]."

"Because we don't increment [code]number[/code] within the while loop, it "

"\r\n"
"As a result, the number is always lower than [code]10[/code], so we never"
" break out of the loop.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Since there's no way to exit the [code]while[/code] loop, the computer "
"will attempt to draw squares infinitely, which will freeze the program."

"At first, you will not need [code]while[/code] loops often. Even the code"
" we show here has more efficient alternatives.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Also, there's a safer kind of loop, [code]for[/code] loops, which we'll "
"look at in the next lesson.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Yet, [code]while[/code] loops have important intermediate to advanced-"
"level uses, so you at least need to know they exist and how to use them."
"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"We use [code]while[/code] loops every time we need to loop an unknown "
"number of times.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"For example, games run in a loop that typically generates 60 images per "
"second until the user closes the game. This is possible thanks to while "
"loops.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"There are other good uses for it:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"- Reading and processing a file, like a text file, line by line.\r\n"
"- Processing a constant stream of data, like someone recording audio with"
" a microphone.\r\n"
"- Reading code and converting it into instructions the computer "
"understands.\r\n"
"- Various intermediate to advanced-level algorithms like finding paths "
"around a map for AI."
