"Learning to program can be daunting.\n"
"\n"
"Yet, you want to make video games, so there is no way around learning to "
"program. Every video game is a computer program.\n"
"\n"
"Programming is the process of writing precise instructions that tell a "
"computer how to perform a task.\n"
"\n"
"A game's instructions are, for example: moving a character, drawing a "
"life bar, or playing a sound."

"To do any of that, you need to learn a programming language: a "

"Programming languages are different from natural ones like English or "
"Spanish. The computer does not think. It can't [i]interpret[/i] what you "
