# Learn GDScript From Zero

Learn GDScript From Zero is a free and open-source app for absolute beginners to learn to program with Godot's GDScript language.

It's a beginner-friendly programming course.

This app is the free part of a larger paid course to become a game developer: [Learn to Code From Zero, with Godot](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses/learn-to-code-from-zero-with-godot).

The series is compatible with Godot 4.

## How to run the app

You can run the app online here: https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/

Also, you can download the app for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Itch.io: https://gdquest.itch.io/learn-godot-gdscript

The desktop version can offer better performance and crisper text than the web version.

## Feedback, requests, and discussions

We value feedback and bug reports. We will also consider feature requests, especially if they fit our vision and we feel they benefit programming beginners.

When participating in discussions, please respect our [Kind Communication Guidelines](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/communication/).

In the [Discussions](https://github.com/GDQuest/learn-gdscript/discussions) tab, you can suggest and upvote ideas for new features, or **ask other community members for help**.

**To report bugs, typos,** and discuss existing tasks, please head to the [Issues](issues) tab instead.

## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome if you feel like giving a hand.

To contribute, you need to follow a couple of guidelines.

First, we ultimately decide on the app's design and features or changes. Before you make a change, please ensure there's an existing [Issues](https://github.com/GDQuest/learn-gdscript/issues) for it, and please let us know you're working on it. 

Here's our GDScript code style guide: [GDQuest GDScript style guide](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/godot-gdscript/).

Please always start pull request titles and commit messages with one of the following prefixes:

- `feat:` for new features.
- `improvement:` for an improvement to an existing feature.
- `fix:` for a bug fix.
- `docs:` for changes to the project's documentation.
- `build:` for anything related to GitHub actions.
- `content:` for changes to lesson and helper text, be it correcting typos, adding new paragraphs, and more.

### How we work

We may directly edit your code to merge it faster when reviewing your changes. This is something we do in our team, too, for efficiency. We may also request changes.

Finally, if some contribution doesn't work for us, we _may_ close the pull request. 

This happens primarily in two cases:

- The changes don't answer an issue we created or vetted.
- The pull request's author didn't make the requested changes for over a month.

### Importing the app in Godot to contribute

**Warning: this is not the recommended way to run the app for learning. Use this only to study the code and contribute.**

You can also run the project straight in Godot by cloning the repository and importing the folder into the engine.

We only recommend importing the app in Godot to study its source code or [contribute](#how-to-contribute). You will need **Godot 3.5 LTS** or a more recent stable version of Godot 3. Otherwise, it won't run.

Please note that practice errors will trigger the debugger and pause execution in Godot, unlike when using the release build. That's normal, and you'll need to continue execution by pressing <kbd>F7</kbd> when that happens.
