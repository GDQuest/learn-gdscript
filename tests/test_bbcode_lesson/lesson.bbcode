[lesson title="Functions that return a value"]
Until now, you learned that functions are a way to group instructions, give them a name, and reuse them.

Functions can also make calculations and [i]return[/i] new values.

[title]Built-in functions that return a value[/title]

Example: the [code]round()[/code] function:

[codeblock]
func run():
	var number = round(3.4)
	print(number)
[/codeblock]

Runnable output (TODO: unsupported yet):

[codeblock runnable="true"]
func run():
	var health = 73.4
	var display_health = round(health)
	print(display_health)
[/codeblock]

[title]A cooler example: lerp()[/title]

The [code]lerp()[/code] function (short for [i]linear interpolate[/i]), blends between two values.

Quiz test:

[quiz_choice question="What does the return keyword do?" multiple="false" shuffle="true"]
    [option]It stops the program entirely[/option]
    [option]It prints a value to the console[/option]
    [option correct]It sends a value back to the code that called the function[/option]
    [option]It creates a new variable[/option]
    [hint]Think about what happens when a function finishes its work.[/hint]
    [explanation]The return keyword sends a value back to wherever the function was called from. This allows you to use the result of the function's calculations.[/explanation]
[/quiz_choice]

[quiz_input question="What is round(4.6)?" answer="5"]
    [hint]The round function rounds to the nearest whole number.[/hint]
    [explanation]4.6 is closer to 5 than to 4, so round(4.6) returns 5.[/explanation]
[/quiz_input]

[practice id="convert-grid-coordinates" title="Converting coordinates from the grid to the screen"]
    [description]We need a function to convert grid coordinates to pixel positions. Complete the function to make the turtle move to the correct cells![/description]
    [goal]
    Complete the function that converts a cell coordinate to a pixel position on the screen.

    Goal description continues here.
    [/goal]
    [starting_code]
    var cell_size = Vector2(80, 80)

    func convert_to_world_coordinates(cell):

    [/starting_code]
    [cursor line="4" column="1"]
    [validator path="convert-grid-coordinates/TestConvertGridCoordinates.gd"]
    [script_slice path="convert-grid-coordinates/ConvertGridCoordinates.gd" name="run"]
    [hint]To convert a cell coordinate to pixels, multiply the [code]cell[/code] by [code]cell_size[/code].[/hint]
    [hint]Use the [code]return[/code] keyword to send the result back. For example: [code]return cell * cell_size[/code][/hint]
