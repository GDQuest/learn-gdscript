CYCLIC_REFERENCE,"A cyclic reference is when a class references itself, directly or indirectly.

It has two possible causes:

1. You used the class name in the class itself.
2. Your code refers to another class that refers to this class, causing an endless reference cycle.

Either way, due to how GDScript works in Godot 3, unfortunately,you cannot do this. Godot 4 should solve this problem, but you need to work around it in the meantime.","Erase the type hint in the error line, and the problem should disappear. 

At GDQuest, when we face this error, we remove the type hints on lines causing cyclic references. It solves the problem in the vast majority of cases."
INVALID_INDENTATION,"The indentation of your code (the number of tab characters at the start of the line) is incorrect.

You are missing one or more tabs, or you inserted too many.

The computer uses those leading tab characters on code lines to know which lines of code are part of a code block, like a function.","If the line of code with the error is right after a line ending with a colon, like a function definition, you need one extra indent level compared to the previous line.

In other words, your line should have one more leading tab character than the function definition."
UNEXPECTED_CHARACTER,"You get this error when you wrote something that is syntactically invalid, or you are missing something to complete this line or previous lines of code.

You need to be extremely precise when you write code for the computer. This kind of error is easy to get as all it takes is one wrong character.

Note that this error can appear [b]after[/b] the line causing it due to how the computer reads and analyzes your code.","The way to solve this kind of error is highly contextual. The error message should tell you which character or element it's missing.

If the error says ""expected,"" then you're likely missing something in one of the [b]previous[/b] code lines. It could be a punctuation mark, a parenthesis, or something else.

If it says ""unterminated,"" you are missing some character at the end of an expression, like a closing bracket. In this case, it most likely comes from the line with the error."
UNEXPECTED_CHARACTER_IN_KEYWORD,"This error tells you that you are missing a parenthesis (or sometimes a comma or a path).

Three keywords in GDScript work like function calls and require parentheses: [code]yield()[/code], [code]preload()[/code], and [code]assert()[/code].","To address the error, you want to add the missing opening parenthesis, the closing parenthesis, or the comma."
UNEXPECTED_CHARACTER_IN_EXPORT_HINT,"This error tells you you are missing some parenthesis, a comma, or some value in your export hint.",You need to read the error message and add the missing character or value it requests.
INVALID_OPERATOR_USAGE,,
MISPLACED_IDENTIFIER,"This error happens in several cases:

1. You wrote an identifier (variable or function name) in the wrong place.
2. You wrote a keyword like [code]var[/code], [code]func[/code], [code]for[/code], or [code]signal[/code], and you did not follow it by a name.
3. You wrote a function definition but forgot the parentheses before the colon.","If the error tells you it expected something, you likely forgot to write a name after a keyword like [code]var[/code], [code]func[/code], [code]for[/code], or [code]signal[/code], making your code invalid. Or you forgot parentheses in a function definition. You can address the error by adding the missing name or parentheses.

If the error says you have something unexpected, you are likely missing a keyword like [code]var[/code], [code]func[/code], [code]for[/code], etc.

Another possibility is that you need to write a colon at the end of a function definition, [code]for[/code] loop, or a line starting with [code]if[/code], [code]elif[/code], or [code]else[/code]."
MISPLACED_TYPE_IDENTIFIER,"This error tells you that you are missing a type somewhere. A type can be [code]int[/code], [code]float[/code], [code]String[/code], [code]Array[/code], [code]Vector2[/code], and many identifiers representing a data structure.

Most of the time, this error occurs when you wrote a colon after a variable name but did not follow it with a type name.

It also occurs when you write an arrow ([code]->[/code]) after the parentheses of a function definition but do not follow it with a type name.","To solve this, you need to write the name of the type after the colon, arrow (in the case of function return types), inside parentheses (for export types), or after the [code]as[/code] keyword."
NONEXISTENT_IDENTIFIER,"The variable, function name, or class name you are trying to use does not exist.

You most often get this error when you make typos. Maybe you swapped two letters, forgot a letter... sometimes, it's hard to spot.

The other cause for this error is that you didn't define the variable, function, or class you're trying to access.","To solve this error, triple-check that there is no typo in the line.

If you can, try to go to the variable or function definition, double-click the name, copy it, and paste it where you see the error.

If you don't see any typo, then you need to ensure that you defined the variable, function, or class you are referring to."
MISPLACED_KEYWORD,"You can only use keywords like [code]break[/code] or [code]continue[/code] in a loop. Outside a loop, they are invalid.

The [code]continue[/code] keyword means ""jump to the next iteration of the loop."" And the [code]break[/code] keyword means ""end the loop right now and jump to the first line of code after the loop block.","If you wrote one of these keywords outside a loop, you need to remove it.

If you are trying to use it inside a loop, your indentation is most likely at fault. You may need to insert one or more leading tab characters to the keyword."
EXPECTED_CONSTANT_EXPRESSION,"When the computer talks about a constant expression, it expects a fixed value, a fixed calculation, or the name of an existing constant.

In other words, it wants something that can never change. This is why the computer will reject function calls and variables where it needs a constant expression.","You need to replace function calls or variables with a constant value like a whole number, decimal number, string, vector, a predefined array, etc.

You can also use arithmetic operators like multiplications (*), additions (+), and so on."
INVALID_CLASS_DECLARATION,"When defining a new class, you need to follow a specific pattern. You must write the name in plain text, starting with a letter.

We typically write class names in PascalCase: with a capital letter at the start of every word that composes the class name.","To fix this error, replace whatever you put after the 'extends' or 'class_name' keyword by a name without spaces and starting with a capital letter.

You can optionally use numbers in the name, but not in the first position."
DUPLICATE_DECLARATION,"You are trying to define a function or variable that already exists; You can't do that.

Perhaps the function or variable already exists in the current code file, but it may also be in a parent class that this GDScript code extends.","In the app, your code extends some built-in Godot code that's not visible to you.

When that happens, you need to either rename your function or variable to one that will not collide with an existing one or remove this line of code."
DUPLICATE_SIGNAL_DECLARATION,"You are trying to define a signal that already exists; You can't do that.

Perhaps the signal already exists in the current code file, but it may also be in a parent class that this GDScript code extends.","In the app, your code extends some built-in Godot code that's not visible to you.

When that happens, you need to either rename your signal to one that will not collide with an existing one or remove this line of code."
SIGNATURE_MISMATCH,"The function you're trying to define exists in a parent class, so your definition overrides the parent class's function.

When you override a parent class's function, the new function must match the parent. The new function should have the same number and type of parameters as the parent class.

For example, if the parent has two arguments, you need your new function also to have two arguments. If you use type hints in your function definitions, the argument types must match the parent class.","You need to check the parent class's function and its definition in the code reference. Then, you need to edit your function definition to have the same number and type of parameters as the parent class."
INVALID_ARGUMENTS,"This whole class of errors has to do with calling functions with either the wrong number of arguments or the wrong kind of argument. You will need to use the error message to see what is going wrong.","You need to either remove, add, or change the values you're trying to pass to the function to solve this issue. To know exactly how many arguments you need, you need to check the code reference. It will show you the function definition and the mandatory arguments."
TYPE_MISMATCH,"All the values in your code have a specific type. That type can be a whole number (int), a decimal number (float), text (String), and so on. There are tons of possible types, and you can even define your own!

When you make any operation, the computer compares the types you are using.

Some types are compatible, and some are not. For example, you cannot directly add a whole number to a text string. You first need to convert the number into text.

You'll need to read the error message to see what is not matching because there are many possible cases.","If the error mentions the assigned value type not matching the variable, the problem is on the right side of the equal sign (=).

If the error talks about the return type not matching the function, then it is the value after the return keyword that is problematic.

If the computer talks about an invalid operand, then the issue is that the operation does not exist for the type you're trying to use. For example, while you can add two 2D vectors, you can't add a whole number or text to a 2D vector."
TYPE_CANNOT_BE_INFERRED,"GDScript supports type inference. The computer will automatically recognize the type of value you are working with. In some cases, though, it can't figure it out.

When that happens, you need to specify the type yourself or remove type inference altogether for this variable.","The simplest way to solve this error is to remove types for this variable or this function's arguments. Otherwise, you can manually specify the value type after the colon.

We recommend specifying the type whenever possible to reap the typing system's benefits."
RETURN_VALUE_MISMATCH,"There is an issue with the return value of your function. There are two main cases here:

1. Your function is a void function, thus it should not return a value. This includes functions with the '-> void' syntax and class constructors ('_init()').
2. You specified a return type for your function, but you are not returning a value in all possible branches (if, elif, and else blocks) or at the end.","When your function is 'void', you should never return a value. You can use the 'return' keyword to end the function early, but you should never write anything after that.

When you use a return type, you must always return something at the end of the function or in every branch (if, elif, and else block) of the function."
MISPLACED_STATIC_CALL,,
INVALID_NO_CATCH, "Godot was unable to load your script, yet the language checker found nothing wrong.", "Please click on the ""report"" button at the top and please let us know."
RECURSIVE_FUNCTION, "You called a function inside itself. This will loop forever.", "There are valid reasons for using recursive functions, but none of them are part of this course, so this cannot be a valid solution."
