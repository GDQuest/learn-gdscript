# This here is a database of GDScript parser and compiler error messages and warnings.
# We use it to create a mapping between identifiable messages and some abstract codes which we
# can refer to internally.
#
# Warnings are already provided by codes, so we can just use an enum exactly like it is defined
# in the engine.
#
# Errors on the other hand are harder. There are two groups of errors, parser errors and compiler
# errors. There is only a few compiler errors, but around 300 well defined parser errors, with
# additional possibility for generic parser errors.
#
# Each error is received with a generic code (-1), and can only be identified by its message
# contents. We store those messages (cleaned up for better maintainability) as is, but we don't
# actually use the raw messages for anything. Instead, each noteworthy message is assigned a
# number of text snippets which are unique to it. These snippets are then used to figure out
# which message was generated. When we successfully identified the message, we give it
# a code from the enum below. That code is then used to fetch our custom error explanation,
# translation, etc. Multiple raw messages can share the same code.
